  <h1>7 Books in 8 Days</h1>
  <p>I’m reading 7 books in the next 8 days  
  I’ll post what I actually get from them  
  Only 1 in  
  Come back later for more</p>
  
  <p><a href="aivalley.html">AI Valley Book Takeaways</a></p>

    <h3>The Age of AI Book Takeaways</h3>
  <p>I learned that doing things just to do them isn’t always smart. I need to be more intentional about the random goals I set and then grind out like an idiot. Reading for 6 hours straight sucked, especially when the book was just a slog of military and regulatory takes on AI. Lesson: optimize for energy, not just completion.</p>

  <p>I’m currently planning my next idiotic goal: sitting in front of ChatGPT for the next few days, probably 50 hours or so (we will see if I actually finish and follow through, hopefully I do), and talking back and forth until I’ve drafted a memoir/autobiography/whatever. Shooting for 300 pages because... why not? That feels sufficient, doesn’t it? Why? Because I want to learn about myself, my values, and how I got here. Baseball was the only thing I ever really cared about, and now it’s gone. Maybe writing this will help me figure out what actually matters next.</p>
