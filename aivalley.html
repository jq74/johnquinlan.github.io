  <h1>What I Learned from <em>The Coming Wave</em></h1>

  <p>Innovation that once felt like the end of the world already happened.</p>

  <p>More than half the US population used to work in agriculture. Then steam, machines, and automation dropped that to under two percent. The internet wiped out entire job categories but also created new ones no one saw coming. AI is just the next wave. People panic, then adapt.</p>

  <p>Economists thought blue collar work would disappear. Robots would replace factory workers. Self-driving trucks would replace drivers. But it was never that simple. People evolve alongside the tech.</p>

  <p>Still, I ask what the point of all this is. Are we really better off because we drive instead of walk, text instead of talk. We've extended life, advanced medicine. But we still die. And when we do, maybe we'll miss the days that were quieter. When attention wasn’t always under attack.</p>

  <p>Yes, we are more efficient. But efficient for what. To waste more time. To scroll more. To lose track of real life.</p>

  <p>Mustafa Suleyman said the future is not written. It is created. That stuck.</p>

  <p>The book breaks down how venture capital works in Silicon Valley. Someone builds something new. Everyone else piles in. They invest in everything so they don’t miss the next wave. They hold shares in all the top companies. So even when they fail, they stay winning.</p>

  <p>I think the people who understand AI and learn how to use it will shape what’s next. But I also think something is slipping away. We spent thousands of years in nature, with rhythm and presence. Now we move fast and feel less. Maybe that’s evolution. Or maybe it’s a trade we won’t fully understand until it’s too late.</p>
